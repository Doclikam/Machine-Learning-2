****Beijing-Multi-Site-Air-Quality-Data-Data-Set****


The present project aims to predict air pollution in Beijing, China, using the data set "Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Data Set"

The present project aims to predict air pollution in Beijing, China, using the "Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Data Set" data set, available at Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data.

This data set includes hourly air pollutant data from 12 air pollution monitoring sites. nationally controlled air quality. The air quality data comes from the Monitoring Center Beijing Municipal Environmental. The meteorological data of each air quality site are related with the nearest weather station of China Meteorological Administration. The period of time It runs from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2017.

A few years ago, China established the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on the level of five pollutants atmospheres, namely sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) measured at the monitoring stations in each city. at each level pollutant is assigned an individual score, and the final AQI is the highest score of those five contaminants. Pollutants can be measured quite differently. SO2, NO2 and PM10 are measured as a daily average. CO and O3 are more damaging and are measured as an hourly average. The end value of AQI is calculated per day and has the interpretation shown in the following table.




**Task 1: Data import, cleanup, and preprocessing**
Focus should be on importing the data provided in a suitable format so that subsequent analysis is more easy. Also verify if it is necessary to perform any data cleaning and/or preprocessing steps.

**Task 2: Exploratory data analysis**
Summarize and visualize data in useful ways. Students must think of interesting questions that they could be verified with the available data and give textual answers or through data visualization.

**Task 3: Predictive modeling**
A predictive task must be defined that can help predict air pollution, through the value of the AQI or Air Pollution Level, depending on its characteristics. After defining the task, you must use the available data to select and obtain a good model for this task. You must justify the suggested model.

**Deliverables**
The project must be carried out by groups of two students and must be sent through the virtual classroom in the Corresponding task, with the following files:

A report (no more than 5 pages) in PDF format with the identification of the members of the group, and with a structure similar to the following:
Introduction;
Definition of the problem;
Data preprocessing;
Exploratory data analysis;
Predictive modeling: experimental setup and results obtained;
Conclusions, limitations and future work;
Annexes (optional).
