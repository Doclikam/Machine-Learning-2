**Beijing-Multi-Site-Air-Quality-Data-Data-Set**


The present project aims to predict air pollution in Beijing, China, using the data set "Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Data Set"

The present project aims to predict air pollution in Beijing, China, using the "Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Data Set" data set, available at Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data.

This data set includes hourly air pollutant data from 12 air pollution monitoring sites. nationally controlled air quality. The air quality data comes from the Monitoring Center Beijing Municipal Environmental. The meteorological data of each air quality site are related with the nearest weather station of China Meteorological Administration. The period of time It runs from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2017.

A few years ago, China established the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on the level of five pollutants atmospheres, namely sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) measured at the monitoring stations in each city. at each level pollutant is assigned an individual score, and the final AQI is the highest score of those five contaminants. Pollutants can be measured quite differently. SO2, NO2 and PM10 are measured as a daily average. CO and O3 are more damaging and are measured as an hourly average. The end value of AQI is calculated per day and has the interpretation shown in the following table.
